<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a third-year engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, navigating the fascinating world of algorithms and data. When I'm not deciphering complex neural networks, I'm diving into the realm of web development to add another feather to my cap. Python programming? Been there, done that, and loved every moment of it! From crafting intricate machine learning models to building sleek, user-friendly web interfaces, I'm on a mission to blend the best of both worlds.</p>

    <p>On the lighter side, you could say I'm the kind of person who dreams in code and occasionally wishes life had a debugging feature. My journey through engineering has been a thrilling roller coaster of zeros and ones, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Whether it's untangling the mysteries of AI or experimenting with the latest web technologies, I'm always up for a challenge. After all, what's life without a few syntax errors and a whole lot of innovation?</p>
